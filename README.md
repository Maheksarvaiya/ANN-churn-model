# ANN-churn-model
# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) using an Artificial Neural Network built from scratch with TensorFlow and Keras. It also features a web interface built using Streamlit.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major concern in industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking. This model helps predict the likelihood of a customer leaving, enabling proactive retention efforts.

## 🏗️ Features

- Binary classification using ANN (Churn / No Churn)
- Feature preprocessing: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Standard Scaling
- Model performance tracking (Accuracy/Loss graphs)
- Real-time prediction using Streamlit Web App
- Accepts user input and returns churn probability

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
